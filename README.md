## 1. What book, album or movie did you choose? What is it about?
I chose The Matrix, which is a science fiction movie exploring the concept of reality versus simulation. The movie follows a hacker named Neo as he discovers that the world in which he lives is merely a simulated reality created by machines to subdue humanity. The movie nails its cyberpunk aesthetics. Its visuals particularly feature the green falling code representing the simulated world. 

## 2. What aspect of the book will you include in your cover?
The Matrix poster I would like to make will focus on the most recognizable visual of the film: the green, falling digital code. This code symbolizes the deconstructed reality and the digital world in which the characters live. The poster will be designed with vertical streams of randomly changing green code falling from the top to the bottom. It will bring dynamic imagery to the poster and an impression of futurism while symbolizing the artificiality of the film's setting. 

## 3. Is it interactive? time-based? both?
The poster shall allow interactivity and a timeline. The falling-code shall always create an animation over time, creating a loop of the green digital streams. In this sense, interactivity shall be given or rendered through mouse events-mouse movement will control the gravity acceleration of the falling code, simulating the manipulation of time and perception, much akin to how that is done within the film's simulated reality. Mouse clicking shall temporarily change the color of the code as though the user were "hacking" the simulation. 

## 4. What ideas would you like to explore or experiment with?  
I would like to explore the random and flowing characteristics of animation and its relation to time and interaction. Specifically, I want to play around with:

- Varying speeds of the falling code in relation to the movement of the mouse.
- Introducing randomness into changing characters within the falling code to enhance the chaotic digital effect.
- Making the poster responsive, allowing immediate user interaction (like mouse movements or clicks) to directly manipulate the behavior of the animation and give users control over the dynamics of the poster.
- Making the background with an atmospheric trail effect through transparency, providing a cyberpunk feel to the poster while keeping the falling code visually present throughout the design. 

## 5. Are there aspects of your project that are related to any of the readings weâ€™ve done?

You know how we have made reference to the interconnectedness of interactivity and real-time response in our discussions? In particular, this tie-in connects with other theory and practices we've learned about designing engaging responsive designs. For instance, the concept of interaction as a cycle-an input from the user (for example, a mouse move) leads the system to modify the behavior of the falling code-sharply reflects similar lessons that we have learned about creating engaging, responsive designs. Timely and design-sensitive move within this connectivity, especially in regard to changes that are time-based and continuous, and how they might affect the perception and experience of a viewer.

#Milestone 2 (due: 2024/10/28)
Pseudo-code, planning and organizing (10 points)
Continue working on the mid-term project.

You should have a MidTerm repository already set up from last week’s assignment, and now you are starting to add some code to your sketch.

By the end of this milestone you should have a pretty solid grasp of the logic that will be required to implement your idea:

Is your project split into different moments? or scenes?
Which interactive events will you respond to? mouse? keyboard? time?
Do you need any special files, arrays or objects?
What are the custom functions that you’ll have to write?
For full credit, projects should use custom functions, some arrays or objects, for() loops and if() statements, and demonstrate forethought and planning.

Your code won’t be finished, but you have started to write it and have implemented some of the shapes or functions that you will use. The rest of your file has placeholders, pseudo-code or simplified versions of your final implementation.

Add a progress writeup at the beginning of your README.md file with:

what you’ve done this week
description of the files, classes, objects or arrays you will use
description of any interactivity or time-based logic
description of functions you have written or will write
